   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to pyCMMS Python code!
=======================================================================================
To make these pages I made sphinx directory in the top-level directory::

   $ mkdir sphinx 

for this directory I ran this command accepting all the defaults::

   $ sphinx-quickstart

I then ran this command to generate the module content::

   $ sphinx-apidoc -o . ..
   
I then modified ``conf.py``, add ``..`` to the ``sys.path`` variable.  I also 
modified the ``copyright`` and ``version`` variables.
   
.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2
   :caption: Contents:

I also added a ``clean`` target to the default ``Makefile`` so that the 
``_build`` directory is removed.
